INTRODUCTION
============

prepl is a REPL implementation, also known as a Lisp listener.

It is written in fully portable Common Lisp (aside from minor
workarounds for implementation-specific issues...), with major
unportable bits being handled by external portability libraries.


HISTORY
=======

prepl is a fork of SBCL's sb-aclrepl module.

Since then, it has been ported to Clozure CL and other Lisps.

Debugging capabilities have been added.

Overall, PREPL does not have Allegro compatibility as a goal, although it
still largely keeps its interface.


USAGE
=====

Manual startup: 
  (asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op 'prepl)
  (prepl:repl)
Enable readline-style repl:
  (prepl:repl :linedit t)


SEE ALSO
========

The Qt version of Hemlock uses PREPL in its Slave buffers.
